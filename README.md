# Project1
This Project uses the Los Angeles Parking Citations dataset from Kaggle.com

*We will review the 3 to 5 year trend of parking citations per month - HW


Questions we will raise...
Type of cars that get the most citations? (HW - I like it)
Areas/streets with the most citations? (HW - makes my mind hurt)


Graphs we will show...
 Scatter plots
 Maybe even a heat map!
